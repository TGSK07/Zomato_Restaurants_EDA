## Problem Statement

With the increasing demand for restaurant discovery platforms, there is a growing need to help food enthusiasts find the best, most cost-effective, and highest-rated places to dine. This analysis leverages Zomato's data to:

* Identify the most popular cuisines in India and other countries
* Discover the top-rated and value-for-money restaurants
* Analyze the geographical concentration and global presence of restaurants
* Evaluate delivery services and their impact on ratings
* Suggest business opportunities for Zomato based on the data

## Dataset Overview

The analysis is based on two CSV files:
* **zomato.csv**: Includes restaurant-specific data like name, cuisine, rating, delivery options, etc.
* **country_Code.csv**: Maps country codes to their names for geographical analysis.

## Key Insights

* **India dominates the dataset**, contributing the majority of entries, with **New Delhi alone accounting for \~68%** of Indian listings.
* **North Indian cuisine** is the most commonly offered, followed by **Chinese**, **Fast Food**, and **Mughlai**, highlighting a strong regional preference for rich, spicy, and familiar flavors.
* The **Philippines, Turkey, and Indonesia** feature the **highest average restaurant ratings**, whereas **India ranks relatively lower**, pointing to possible regional satisfaction gaps or rating patterns.
* **Online delivery** is available across many restaurants, yet **not all highly-rated establishments offer it**. However, restaurants like *Zolocrust* and *Caterspoint* prove that **quality and convenience can go hand-in-hand**.
* **Naturals Ice Cream** stands out with a **perfect 5.0 rating**, reflecting excellent customer satisfaction.
* **No strong correlation** exists between the number of votes and overall ratings, suggesting that popularity doesn‚Äôt always mean better quality.
* A subset of restaurants in Indian cities offers **high ratings at low cost**, representing the **best value-for-money options**.

## Suggestions

* **Promote underrated gems**: Highlight high-rated restaurants with fewer votes to improve their visibility.
* **Expand online delivery offerings**: Encourage high-quality restaurants without delivery services to adopt online models.
* **Focus on high-rating countries**: Explore business expansion or marketing in countries like Turkey and the Philippines.
* **Highlight value-driven dining**: Use "Value for Money" badges to recommend restaurants offering quality at affordable prices.
* **Improve quality in saturated markets**: Regular audits or incentive programs could be useful in overrepresented yet underperforming regions like New Delhi.
